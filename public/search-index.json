    "content": "Architecture High-level architecture and design principles of govman. System Overview govman is a command-line tool for managing multiple Go versions with automatic version switching support. Design Goals 1. Simple: Easy to install and use 2. Fast: Quick downloads, efficient switching 3. Reliable: Verified downloads, atomic operations 4. Cross-platform: Works on Linux, macOS, Windows 5. Shell-agnostic: Supports Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell Architecture Layers Layer Responsibilities 1. CLI Layer ( ) Purpose: User interaction and command handling Responsibilities: - Parse command-line arguments - Validate user input - Display formatted output - Handle errors gracefully - Show progress indicators Key Components: - Root command initialization - Subcommand registration - Flag parsing - Output formatting - Help text generation Example: 2. Manager Layer ( ) Purpose: Business logic orchestration Responsibilities: - Coordinate between services - Implement workflows - Handle transactions - Manage state - Error recovery Key Operations: - - Download, verify, extract, install - - Remove version and clean up - - Switch active version - - Query installed/remote versions - - Get active version Example: 3. Service Layer Config Service ( ) Purpose: Configuration management Features: - YAML configuration loading - Default values - Path expansion - Validation - Directory creation Configuration Structure: yaml autoswitch: enabled: true projectfile: .govman-version Downloader Service ( ) Purpose: Download and extract Go distributions Features: - HTTP downloads with resume support - SHA-256 verification - Archive extraction (tar.gz, zip) - Progress reporting - Retry with backoff - Path traversal protection Download Flow: Golang API Service ( ) Purpose: Interact with Go releases API Features: - Fetch available versions - Parse release metadata - Version comparison - Platform-specific file selection - Cache management API Integration: Shell Service ( ) Purpose: Shell-specific integration Features: - Shell detection (Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell) - Configuration file management - PATH manipulation - Auto-switch hooks - Initialization code generation Shell Interface: Example Implementation: Symlink Service ( ) Purpose: Manage symbolic links Features: - Create symlinks - Read symlink targets - Cross-platform support - Atomic updates Key Design Patterns 1. Layered Architecture Each layer depends only on layers below it: Benefits: - Clear separation of concerns - Easy to test individual layers - Can swap implementations 2. Dependency Injection Services are injected into Manager: Benefits: - Easy to mock for testing - Configurable behavior - Loose coupling 3. Strategy Pattern (Shell Integration) Different shells implement common interface: 4. Singleton Pattern (Logger) Global logger instance: 5. Factory Pattern (Progress Bars) Create progress bars based on context: 6. Builder Pattern (HTTP Requests) Build complex requests: Error Handling Strategy Error Wrapping Always wrap errors with context: Error Recovery Manager handles rollback on failure: User-Friendly Errors Logger provides helpful error messages: Concurrency Model Thread Safety Manager uses mutex for critical sections: Concurrent Downloads Future: Support parallel downloads: State Management Version State Tracked via filesystem: Configuration State Stored in YAML: Shell State Maintained in shell config: Performance Considerations 1. Caching - Release data cached for 1 hour - Downloaded archives kept in cache - Symlinks for fast switching 2. Incremental Operations - Resume interrupted downloads - Skip re-download if cached - Atomic symlink updates 3. Efficient Extraction - Stream extraction (no double disk usage) - Skip unnecessary files - Parallel extraction (future) 4. Minimal Overhead - Auto-switch checks are fast (<1ms) - Lazy initialization - No background processes Security Considerations 1. Checksum Verification Always verify SHA-256: 2. Path Traversal Prevention Validate all paths: 3. HTTPS Only All downloads use HTTPS: 4. Minimal Permissions Files created with restrictive permissions: Extensibility Adding New Shells 1. Implement interface 2. Add detection logic 3. Register in factory Adding New Commands 1. Create command file in 2. Implement command logic 3. Register in Adding New Configuration Options 1.

Minimal Dependency Philosophy govman follows a minimal dependency approach: Why Minimal Dependencies? 1. Security: Fewer dependencies = smaller attack surface 2. Reliability: Less risk of breakage from updates 3. Performance: Smaller binary size 4. Maintenance: Fewer updates needed Dependencies We Avoided - UI frameworks: Used standard output instead - HTTP libraries: Standard is sufficient - Logging frameworks: Built custom lightweight logger - Configuration libraries: Viper handles our needs - Progress bars: Built custom implementation When We Add Dependencies Only when: 1. Feature requires complex implementation 2. Standard library doesn't provide functionality 3. Dependency is well-maintained and widely used 4. License is permissive Binary Size Impact | Component | Size Contribution | |-----------|-------------------| | Go standard library | ~1.2 MB | | cobra | ~500 KB | | viper | ~800 KB | | golang.org/x/mod | ~100 KB | | govman code | ~300 KB | | Total | ~3 MB | Stripped and compressed: ~2 MB Version Compatibility Go Version Requirements - Minimum: Go 1.20 - Recommended: Go 1.21+ - Tested: Go 1.20, 1.21, 1.22 Dependency Version Strategy - Use stable versions (no pre-releases) - Pin major versions to avoid breaking changes - Test before upgrading major versions - Keep dependencies reasonably up-to-date for security See Also - Project Structure - Code organization - Architecture - System design - Getting Started - Development setup --- Understanding dependencies helps with security, maintenance, and troubleshooting! 📦"

Detect your current shell 2. Add govman configuration to your shell's RC file 3. Set up PATH and environment variables 4. Enable auto-switching functionality Then restart your terminal or reload your shell configuration. Supported Shells | Shell | OS Support | Auto-Switch | Status | |-------|-----------|-------------|--------| | Bash | macOS, Linux, Windows (Git Bash) | ✅ Yes | Fully Supported | | Zsh | macOS, Linux | ✅ Yes | Fully Supported | | Fish | macOS, Linux | ✅ Yes | Fully Supported | | PowerShell | Windows, macOS, Linux | ✅ Yes | Fully Supported | | Command Prompt | Windows | ❌ No | Limited Support | Shell-Specific Instructions Bash Auto-Initialize Manual Setup Add to : Then reload: Zsh Auto-Initialize Manual Setup Add to : Then reload: Fish Auto-Initialize Manual Setup Add to : Then reload: PowerShell Auto-Initialize Manual Setup Add to your PowerShell profile ( ): Then reload: Command Prompt (Windows) Command Prompt has limited auto-switching capabilities. Use PowerShell for better experience. Basic Setup After running , the PATH is configured. Manual version switching is required: Limitations: - ❌ No automatic version switching - ❌ No directory change hooks - ✅ Manual switching works Recommendation: Use PowerShell instead for full functionality. Features Auto-Switching When enabled, govman automatically switches Go versions when you enter a directory containing a file. Enable/Disable In : How It Works 1. You enter a directory: 2. govman checks for 3. If found, it reads the version number 4. If different from current, it switches automatically 5. You see: Example PATH Management govman automatically manages multiple PATH entries: 1. govman bin: - The govman binary 2. Active Go: - Current Go version 3. GOBIN: - User-installed Go tools 4. GOPATH: - Project-installed tools 5. Default Go bin: - Default Go workspace Environment Variables govman sets/manages: - - Includes govman and active Go version - - Set to (prevents automatic downloads) - - If set, added to PATH - - Binary path added to PATH Advanced Configuration Custom Project File Name Use a different filename instead of : Multiple Shell Support If you use multiple shells, initialize each: Force Re-initialization Overwrite existing configuration: Troubleshooting Auto-Switch Not Working Check if enabled: Verify .govman-version exists: Test manually: Wrong Version After cd Check file content: Verify version is installed: Install if missing: Shell Integration Not Loaded Verify configuration exists: Reload shell: Re-initialize: PATH Not Updated Check PATH: Verify wrapper function: Manual reload: Uninstalling Shell Integration Remove Configuration Edit your shell RC file and remove the section between: Files to check: - Bash: or - Zsh: - Fish: - PowerShell: Reload Shell Clean Removal Script Use the uninstall script: Best Practices 1. Commit .govman-version Always commit to ensure team consistency: 2. Use Auto-Switch in Development Keep auto-switch enabled for seamless development: 3. Disable in CI/CD For reproducible builds, disable auto-switch and use explicit versions: 4.
